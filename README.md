## Inspiration
We were inspired by our nights at university where we would get hungry but were sick and tired of eating fast food. We wanted something home cooked and so we decided to develop this app to help solve our problem. It will allow university students like ourselves to take pictures of foods that they have lying around and get tasty and easy to make recipes that they can make.
