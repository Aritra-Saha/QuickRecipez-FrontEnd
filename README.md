# QuickRecipez-FrontEnd
Easy-to-make Recipes at the press of a button!
## General Information
This is the front-end of a native mobile camera app that allows the user to take a picture of foods they want to cook with and returns to the user a list of recipes with information such as a title, description, directions, ingredients and nutritional value.
## Technologies Used
* React Native
* Expo
* React Navigation
* Expo Camera
* JSON
## Inspiration
We were inspired by our nights at university where we would get hungry but were sick and tired of eating fast food. We wanted something home cooked and so we decided to develop this app to help solve our problem. It will allow university students like ourselves to take pictures of foods that they have lying around and get tasty and easy to make recipes that they can make.
## What we Learned
We learned to develop on the React Native framework while testing on the Expo Client. In React Native, we learned JSX, React Navigation, and how to use the Expo Camera. Furthermore, we learned how to parse JSON information and use the FETCH API to network this information from the back end to the front end.
## Challenges
* Dependecy Issues
* Design Decisions
* Github Issues
* Navigation between screens
